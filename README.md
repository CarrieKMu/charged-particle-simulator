# Charged Particle Simulator (using Godot)
- Developed a code that simulates how two charged particles behave in a in a vacuum environment over time
- Coded the simulator to generate 3 positions vs. time graphs, mapping out the trajectory each particle takes in the
x, y, and z directions respectively
- Implemented a parsing algorithm that allows user to input the initial characteristics of each particle, including its,
mass,charge, initial velocity, and initial position
- Collaborated with my physics professor for feedback
